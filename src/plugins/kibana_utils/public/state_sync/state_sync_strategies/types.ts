/**
 * Sync strategy is responsible for serialising / deserialising and persisting / retrieving stored state

 *
 * SyncStrategy.Url: the same as old persisting of expanded state in rison format to the url
 * SyncStrategy.HashedUrl: the same as old persisting of hashed state using sessionStorage for storing expanded state
 *
 * Possible to provide own custom SyncStrategy by implementing ISyncStrategy

 * SyncStrategy.Url is default
