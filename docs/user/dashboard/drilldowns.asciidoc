[[drilldowns]]
=== Use drilldowns for dashboard actions

Drilldowns, also known as custom actions, allow you to configure a
workflow for analyzing and troubleshooting your data.
For example, using a drilldown, you can navigate from one dashboard to another,
taking the current time range, filters, and other parameters with you,
so the context remains the same. You can continue your analysis from a new perspective.

You might have a dashboard that shows the overall status of multiple data centers.
You can create a drilldown that navigates from this dashboard to a dashboard
that shows a single data center or server.

==== How drilldowns work

Drilldowns are user-configurable {kib} actions that are stored with the
dashboard metadata. Drilldowns are specific to the dashboard panel
for which you create them&mdash;they are not shared across panels.
A panel can have multiple drilldowns.

This example shows a dashboard panel that contains a pie chart.
Typically, clicking a pie slice applies the current filter.
When a panel has a drilldown, clicking a pie slice opens a menu with
the default action and your drilldowns.

Third-party developers can create drilldowns.
Refer to https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/x-pack/examples/ui_actions_enhanced_examples[this example plugin]
to learn how to code drilldowns.

==== Create and manage drilldowns

Your dashboard must be in *Edit* mode to create a drilldown.
Once a panel has at least one drilldown, the menu also includes a *Manage drilldowns* action
for editing and deleting drilldowns.
