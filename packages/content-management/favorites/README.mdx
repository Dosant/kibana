## Description

The Favorites service provides a way to add favorites feature to your content. It includes a service for managing the list of favorites and a set of components for displaying and interacting with the list.

- The favorites are isolated per user, per space.
- The service provides an API for adding, removing, and listing favorites.
- The service provides a set of react-query hooks for interacting with the favorites list
- The components include a button for toggling the favorite state of an object
- The service relies on ambiguous object ids to identify the objects being favorite. This allows the service to be used with any type of content, not just saved objects.

## API

```tsx
// client side
import {
  FavoritesClient,
  FavoritesContextProvider,
  useFavorites,
  FavoriteButton,
} from '@kbn/content-management-favorites-public';

const favoriteObjectType = 'dashboard';
const favoritesClient = new FavoritesClient('dashboard', {
  http: core.http,
});

// wrap your content with the favorites context provider
const myApp = () => {
  <FavoritesContextProvider favoritesClient={favoritesClient}>
    <App />
  </FavoritesContextProvider>;
};

const App = () => {
  // get the favorites list
  const favoritesQuery = useFavorites();

  // display favorite state and toggle button for an object
  return <FavoriteButton id={'some-object-id'} />;
};
```

## Implementation Details

Internally the favorites list is backed by a saved object. A saved object of type "favorite" is created for each user (user profile id) and space (space id) combination when a user for the first time favorites an object. The saved object contains a list of favorite object ids grouped by favorite type.

```
{
  "_index": ".kibana_8.16.0_001",
  "_id": "spaceid:favorite:u_profile_id",
  "_source": {
    "favorite": {
      "userId": "u_profile_id",
      "favorites": {
        "dashboard": ['favorite-dashboard-id-1', 'favorite-dashboard-id-2'],
        "visualization": ['favorite-visualization-id-1'],
      }
    },
    "type": "favorite",
    "references": [],
    "namespace": "spaceid",
  }
},
```

The service doesn't track the favorite object itself, only the object id. When the object is deleted, the favorite isn't removed from the list automatically.
